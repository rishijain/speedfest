SETUP NEEDED:

1. gem install gosu.
Note: gosu has some weird issues working along with rvm. So if you are facing issues in installing gosu on rvm backed ruby
, switch to system ruby(rvm system) and install on it.

RULES:

1. Do not use the backspace/delete key. Once you have typed in something, you have typed in. There is no going back.

GAME PLAY:

1. Run the game, just type in: ruby game.rb
2. Start typing the word you see on the screen.
3. Press ENTER to go to the next word.
